Installation of Pyjobber
========================

Installation of pyjobber should be straight forward. Pull Pyjobber from github by:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    $ git pull https://github.com/XeBoris/pyjobber pyjobber

Afterwards enter the directory and install Pyjobber in your Python environment

.. code-block:: bash

    $ cd pyjobber
    $ python setup.py install
    
Alternativly you can install Pyjobber in develop mode

.. code-block:: bash

    $ python setup.py develop
    
Pyjobber is only a simple Python workflow manager. Don't expect to much fancy stuff around. You need to re-install Pyjobber after developing a new module or interface.
